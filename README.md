##Project_Description
This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed and developed using modern front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, experiences, and interests as a computer science engineering student and aspiring web developer. The website is structured to reflect a clean and professional design, allowing visitors—such as recruiters, peers, or collaborators—to easily navigate through my work and get a quick yet comprehensive overview of who I am and what I do. Built from scratch with a focus on layout precision and user experience, the website offers multiple sections including an About Me page, Projects gallery, Skills list, Certificates, and a Contact form for quick communication.

Stylistically, I made use of CSS Flexbox and Grid to create a well-balanced and responsive layout that adapts smoothly across devices—from desktops to smartphones. Smooth scroll navigation, hover effects, and subtle animations enhance the interactivity of the site without making it overwhelming. I carefully selected colors, fonts, and spacing to give the site a modern yet personal aesthetic. All content is editable, and the project structure is modular to allow for future updates as I add new projects or accomplishments. The contact section includes a working form with required validation and is styled to fit the overall theme of the site.

The Projects section highlights key technical projects I’ve built or contributed to, linking directly to their GitHub repositories or live demos. In addition, the Certificates and Workshops section reflects my commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement, listing verified achievements in areas like web development, design, and more. The Skills section uses icons and rating bars to visually represent my proficiency in various technologies, making it easier for visitors to get a quick sense of where my strengths lie.

This project helped me improve not just my technical abilities but also my sense of design, accessibility, and content structure. By building my own website from scratch, I learned the importance of clear navigation, responsive design, and consistent branding. It also gave me hands-on experience in deploying a static website on platforms like GitHub Pages and handling basic SEO optimizations to ensure my site is discoverable. Overall, this portfolio website represents both my technical and creative identity online. It’s not only a showcase of what I’ve done but also a foundation that I can continue to expand and evolve as my journey in tech continues.
